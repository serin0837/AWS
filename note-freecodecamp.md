1. why get aws CCP?
   (lite version of solution architect associate)

- Learning AWS foundational knowledge
- Shows you have poked around and can use the AWS console
- Focuses on billing and business-centric concepts
- Commonly obtained by sales and management to help inform VPs and CEO reasons to utilize AWS

2. what value does CCP hold?

- Not a gilded title
- Can help superficially increase your AWS Certification count
- Not recognized as an important cert for developers on resumes
  (maybe not worth to get cert than?)
